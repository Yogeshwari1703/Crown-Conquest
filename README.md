# 👑 Crown Conquest: N-Queens Solver Game

## 📌 Overview

**Crown Conquest** is a puzzle-style game based on the famous **N-Queens Problem**.
The challenge is to place **N queens** on an **N×N chessboard** such that no two queens attack each other.
This project implements two powerful algorithms:

* **Backtracking** → Classic recursive search method.
* **Branch and Bound** → Optimized search with constraints to reduce exploration.

The game is both educational and fun, letting you **visualize** how these algorithms solve the N-Queens challenge.

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Run the program in VS Code or any Python environment.
2. Enter the board size (**N**).
3. Watch the queens get placed step by step using:

   * **Backtracking Algorithm**
   * **Branch and Bound Algorithm**
4. Compare how fast and efficient each method is.
